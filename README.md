# CREPDL

Implementation of ISO/IEC 19757-7 (CREPDL) in F#

## Overview

This is a .Net library. It is usable from any .Net programming language such as C# and Visual Basic.

There is a command-line program for invoking this library. But it is rudimentary.

This does not contain any examples of CREPDL scripts. See another repository CREPDLScripts for a collection of CREPDL scripts.

## Branches

Use the branch "version2". The other branches are archaic.

## Programming

Use Visual Studio 2015 (and beyond) for cloning this repository.

Use the CREPDL project in the CREPDL solution. The other projects are for testing, preprocessing, and experiments.

The .Net API for this implementation idescribed in a [help file](https://github.com/CITPCSHARE/CREPDL/blob/Version2/Help/Documentation.chm).  Use the download button to download the help file.  This help file covers many classes, but you need Validation.Validator  and nothing else.
